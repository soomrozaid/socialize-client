# Socialize

This project is essentially a demonstration for my skills as a UX/UI Developer.

This web app is a social media platform with all of its complex features.

The name of the app is an oxymoron as in the app you post _screams_, which is the worst way to socialize.

## Features

All of the feature in this app are basically api endpoints, which actually makes the total size of the app significantly smaller.

### Posting a Scream
### Checking out a user's profile
### Receiving Notifications
### Commenting on a Scream
### Liking and Unliking a Scream
